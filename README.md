# JBoss Fuse Quick Starts

This project contains multiple Quick Starts intended for use with JBoss Fuse. These Quick starts are intended to be very basic beginner level projects that demonstrate a single concept at a time. In some cases more Advanced Quick Starts are included that build upon the basic Quick Start to demonstrate more complex features. All of these are designed to get someone started quickly with a given component and are not designed to be full solutions. Quick starts are provided for both Fuse on Karaf as well as Fuse on EAP.
